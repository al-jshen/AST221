However, neither the precise timing, nor the mechanisms, nor the full consequences of this mass loss are yet well understood. Stellar pulsation may play a key role: it is closely associated with evolutionary phases where substantial mass loss occurs, and there are good physical reasons to expect pulsation to cause, or at least greatly to enhance, mass loss. Here we point out that there are many possible consequences, some not previously recognized, of pulsation-related mass loss for the evolutionary behaviour of post-main sequence stars. We advance the hypothesis that most mass loss of evolutionary significance is closely related to stellar pulsation.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We propose an explanation for the positive correlation of bipolar planetary nebulae with massive progenitors in the paradigm of binary system progenitors. We list 10 critical observations, and argue that single-star models for the formation of bipolar planetary nebulae encounter difficulties complying with these observations. On the other hand, binary system progenitors can naturally explain these key observations, and in addition explain the rich varieties of structures possessed by bipolar planetary nebulae. Based on three of the critical observations, and on previous works by Corradi and Schwarz and by Morris, we postulate that the progenitors of bipolar planetary nebulae are binary stellar systems in which the secondary diverts a substantial fraction of the mass lost by the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) primary, but the systems avoid the common envelope phase for a large fraction of the interaction time. The positive correlation of bipolar planetary nebulae with massive progenitors, M ≳ 2 M☉, is attributed to the larger ratios of red giant branch (RGB) to AGB radii which low-mass stars attain, compared with massive stars. These larger radii on the RGB cause most stellar binary companions, which potentially could have formed bipolar planetary nebulae if the primary had been on the AGB, to interact with low-mass primaries already on the RGB. This scenario predicts that the central stars of most bipolar planetary nebulae are in binary systems having orbital periods in the range of a few days to few times 10 yr.}

We focus on thermal pulses due to their particular importance for the evolution of hydrogen deficient stars. It is shown that overshoot applied to all convection regions is a key ingredient to model these objects leading to intershell abundances already close to the surface abundances of Wolf-Rayetcentral stars. In contrast to standard evolutionary calculations, overshoot models do show dredge up for very low envelope masses and efficient dredge up was found even during the post-AGB stage. Three thermal pulse scenarios for Wolf-Rayet central stars can nowbe distinguished: an AGB Final Thermal Pulse (AFTP) occurring at the very end of the AGB evolution, a Late Thermal Pulse (LTP) occurring during the post-AGBevolution when hydrogen burning is still on, and a Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) occurring on the cooling branch when hydrogen burning has already ceased. All scenarios lead to hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars with carbon and oxygen abundances as observed for Wolf-Rayet stars.Hydrogen is either diluted by dredge up (AFTP, LTP) or completely burnt (VLTP).",

These nonzero closure phases can only be generated by asymmetric brightness distributions of the target stars or their surroundings. We discuss how these results were obtained and how they might be interpreted in terms of structures on or near the target stars. We also report measured angular sizes and hypothesize that most Mira stars would show detectable asymmetry if observed with adequate angular resolution.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Low- and intermediate-mass stars eject much of their mass during the late, red giant branch (RGB) phase of evolution. The physics of their strong stellar winds is still poorly understood. In the standard model, stellar pulsations extend the atmosphere, allowing a wind to be driven through radiation pressure on condensing dust particles. Here, we investigate the onset of the wind, using nearby RGB stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog. We find a sharp onset of dust production when the star first reaches a pulsation period of 60 days. This approximately coincides with the point where the star transitions to the first overtone pulsation mode. Models of the spectral energy distributions show stellar mass-loss rate suddenly increasing at this point, by a factor of ∼10 over the existing (chromospherically driven) wind. The dust emission is strongly correlated with both pulsation period and amplitude, indicating stellar pulsation is the main trigger for the strong mass loss, and determines the mass-loss rate. Dust emission does not strongly correlate with stellar luminosity, indicating radiation pressure on dust has little effect on the mass-loss rate. RGB stars do not normally appear to produce dust, whereas dust production by asymptotic giant branch stars appears commonplace, and is probably ubiquitous above the RGB-tip luminosity. We conclude that the strong wind begins with a step change in mass-loss rate and is triggered by stellar pulsations. A second rapid mass-loss-rate enhancement is suggested when the star transitions to the fundamental pulsation mode at a period of ∼300 days.}
