Hi! I’m Jeff and my topic is the formation of planetary nebulae, which are clouds of ionized gases. An AGB star starts off with several solar masses, but ends up as a white dwarf, which is at most 1.4 solar masses. A planetary nebula is formed from some of the mass that is lost during the transition. Two mechanisms that drive mass loss are stellar winds and pulsation. 

Stellar winds are caused by radiation pressure from the star imparting momentum onto grains of dust in the stellar atmosphere. As these grains of dust are ejected away from the star, they carry some of the surrounding gases along with them. Knowing this, we can derive most of this mass loss equation. Mass loss increases with radiation pressure, so luminosity, and is inversely proportional to surface gravity because there is less "resistance". That's the R over M term in this equation. If we plug in some numbers like 4 solar masses to cancel with that 4, several thousand solar luminosities, and a few hundred solar radii, we get like 10^-6 or so solar masses lost per year, which is about right. 

Late-stage AGB stars also pulsate, and that causes shock waves which increase the density of dust in the atmosphere. More density means that more stuff gets pushed away. Pulsation period also happens to be related to luminosity in that both increase as the star ages. From this, we can see that towards the end of a star’s lifetime, mass loss increases exponentially to somewhere in the range of 10^-4 solar masses per year, and that might be the cause for the so-called ”superwind” which blows out a bunch of the gas that a planetary nebula is made of.
